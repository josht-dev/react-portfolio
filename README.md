## Description

This is my portfolio page giving a little about myself, displaying some of my work, and a few ways to get in contact with me. It is built using react. It is a place for potential employers to get to know me and my work. It is the culmination of everything I have learned of front-end development during my time at the DU Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The website is responsive to screen sizes, resizing as needed. The projects in the Work tab can be clicked to open the deployed sites in a separate tab. There are several contact links and a form to send me a message. The resume tab has a button to download a pdf of my resume. The download resume and contact me sections are not currently functional and will be updated at another time. They are included for future development.
